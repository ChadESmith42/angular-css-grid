# Global Style Classes

The global styles are mostly concerned with the main content container layout for this application.

The main layout of the site is four rows and one column. The rows contain the navigation bar, a full-width content
container, an adjustable/dynamic content container, and a footer bar. The navigation bar, adjustable content, and
footer bar all have internal grid layouts. The internal grids are handled inside the component SCSS files.

There are five classes applied to the primary layout: app-container, nav, wide, adjustable, and footer. Each of
those `<div>` elements contain an Angular component.
